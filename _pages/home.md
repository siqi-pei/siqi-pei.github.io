## <left> About Me </left>

My name is Siqi Pei, and I am currently serving as an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the College of Business, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. Additionally, I am a visiting scholar at MIT Sloan School of Management. My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Information Systems, which I received from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022.

My research interests include digital platforms, economics of artificial intelligence, social welfare, policy, and environmental issues. In terms of methodologies, I employ causal inference, machine learning, field experiments, and lab experiments in my work.
