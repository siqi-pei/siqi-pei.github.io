## <left> ABOUT ME </left>

I am an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the Eli Broad College of Business, Michigan State University.
My research focuses on the digital economy, influencer marketing, automotive marketing, and human–AI interactions, with a broader interest in how emerging technologies shape consumer behavior and social welfare.
I employ field experiments, causal inference, and machine learning to generate insights that inform both marketing strategy and policy.

My work has been published in leading journals such as Information Systems Research and Management Science, and has received multiple awards, including the WISE Best Paper Award. 
I have also collaborated with industry partners such as Nissan and Secoo on projects related to digital transformation and consumer decision-making.

If you are interested in collaborating with me or working with me as a research assistant, please feel free to contact me at [peisiqi@msu.edu](...).
