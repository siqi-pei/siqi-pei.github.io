## <left> About Me </left>

My name is Siqi Pei, and I am currently serving as an Assistant Professor of Marketing at the College of Business, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. My academic background includes a Ph.D. in Information Systems, which I received from the Chinese University of Hong Kong in 2022.

My research interests center on three interconnected areas: (1) the economic and social impacts of digital technologies; (2) the effectiveness of automotive sales, with a particular emphasis on digital marketing strategies and the consumer decision-making process; and (3) the effectiveness of influencer marketing. In terms of methodologies, I employ causal inference, machine learning, field experiments, and lab experiments in my work.
