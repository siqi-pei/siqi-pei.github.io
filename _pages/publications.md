### 1. Siqi PEI, Jialu LIU, and Xiaoquan (Michael) ZHANG, “Online Food Delivery Platforms and Female Labor Force Participation”, Major revision at Information Systems Research  

**Abstract:** Female labor force participation is often explained by factors such as schooling, wage gap, fertility, etc. We identify how technology-induced time savings from household chores led to increased female labor force participation in South Korea. Using a leads-and-lags difference-in-differences model, we find that the entry of an online food delivery platform significantly increased the female employment rate in the next three years. We estimate the positive externality generated by the online food delivery platform: this new technology-induced female employment accounts for 0.27% of South Korea’s GDP, or 17 times the revenue of the online food delivery platform.

  
### 2. Siqi PEI, Jialu LIU, and Xiaoquan (Michael) ZHANG, “Environmental Regulation and Political Corruption”, Major revision at Management Science  

**Abstract:** Exploiting the spatial discontinuity in monitoring water pollutants, we examine whether technology can reduce the political agency problem in the context of combating water pollution by examining the corruptive activities between firms and local officials. We find that technology alone is not effective in reducing the corruption between firms and local officials. However, corruption is significantly reduced when technology is complemented by organizational changes. Further analyses show that the reduction in corruption is significantly larger in locations where local officials have stronger political promotion incentives. Our findings demonstrate that to mitigate the political agency problem in combating pollution, policymakers should introduce accompany new technologies with organizational changes.

  
### 3. Siqi PEI and Keehyung KIM, “Rewarding Experts in Revenue-sharing Crowdfunding: An Experimental Study”, Under review at Management Science

**Abstract:** Crowdfunding platforms often utilize expert investors to provide professional advice to help crowd investors make more informed investment decisions. In return, an incentive mechanism implemented in the platforms allows experts to collect a small fee (carry) from crowd investors or startup companies. This study experimentally examines (1) how the carry structure (the existence and the source of the carry) affects the objectivity of the expert’s report and (2) whether the startup and the crowd investor can strategically respond by anticipating the expert’s bias. We introduce an abstract model that captures key features of revenue-sharing crowdfunding with three parties (a startup, an expert, and a crowd investor) where the expert’s report plays an influential role. Experimental results show that the expert tends to overreport to favor the startup when the startup pays the carry. However, the expert exhibits aversion to lying when the carry is from the crowd investor. This suggests that the expert reciprocates to the party who covers the payment. Furthermore, both the startup and the crowd investor anticipate the expert’s reporting behavior and strategically respond by adjusting project quality and investment amount. For example, both project quality and investment amount are the highest in the least biased treatment (when the carry is from the crowd investor). To explain the empirical regularities, we develop and estimate a behavioral model that captures the expert’s psychological tradeoff between being self-interested and remaining objective. Our findings provide insights to crowdfunding platform designers and policymakers in designing an effective incentive mechanism.

###  1. Siqi PEI, Yiying ZHANG, Juan FENG, Xiaoquan (Michael) ZHANG, “Does Personal Data Always Help to Increase Revenue of Online Shopping Platform?”, In preparation for submission to Management Science

**Abstract:** More personal data on customers’ demographics and behavior history is usually thought helpful to boost revenue of online shopping platform by effectively recommending the products consumers are most likely to be interested in. We suggest a countervailing market force: the recommendation algorithm using personal data may not perform better than that the algorithm does not use it, because consumers consider not only interests but also uncertainty when making the purchase decisions, and the personal data can not help to reduce consumers’ uncertainty concerns. We examine this hypothesis empirically using field experiment data from an established online shopping platform. Our findings are consistent with this hypothesis: the recommendation algorithm which does not use personal data as input actually performs better in terms of purchase.

**Abstract:** The influencer marketing is one of the most widely used approaches to showcase brand’s products and services on social media platforms nowadays. Different from the celebrity endorsement, the wide range of social media influencers’ impact and the emerging influencer market system makes it difficult for brands to set a reasonable and consistent price strategy for social media influencers’ advertising services. In practice, the most common way is to pay the influencers according to their follower numbers. However, the simple pricing method suffers problems, the most severe one is that the aggregate value various influencers created together for the advertiser is not linear with their follower numbers. To the advertiser, the advertising cost should be proportional to the market value (effectiveness of advertisement) each influencer generates, rather than their follower numbers. The transparency of social media enables us to quantify the effectiveness of each influencer’s advertisement, we thus propose a model which takes advantage of the superiorities of influencer marketing and set one influencer’s price according to the share of the total commercial value (relative market value) he/she captured. We measure the influencer’s relative market value based on his/her follower proportion and attractive capability. Our model has several important implications for the industry.
